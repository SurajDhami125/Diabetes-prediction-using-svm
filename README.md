# Diabetes Prediction Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📄 Project Description
This project uses a **machine learning approach** to predict diabetes based on the Diabetes dataset.  
We implement a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier with **feature scaling** to achieve the best possible accuracy.

## 🛠 Features
- Binary classification: predicts whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)
- Uses StandardScaler to normalize input features
- Evaluates model performance using **accuracy**
